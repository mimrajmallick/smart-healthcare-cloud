# Smart Healthcare System on Cloud 🩺☁️

This is a personal project I'm currently working on. The goal is to build a cloud-based healthcare web application that helps users:

- Check symptoms through interactive forms.
- Store and manage medical records digitally.
- Access useful healthcare tools remotely.

## 🚀 Project Status

Right now, the project is in its early planning and setup stage.  
I'm working on the architecture, deciding on the tech stack, and laying out a roadmap for development.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- Node.js & Express.js for backend
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend
- REST APIs and possibly Cloud Functions
